  About This Project I have always enjoyed journaling, whether it be about projects that I am working on in school or on the side, or things I am experiencing in my life. It serves as an escape from reality and as a way to reflect on my experiences and improve myself. Specifically with coding, I find it beneficial to journal about school and personal projects because I learn the material better and more often than not discover alternate ways that I could have used to solve various problems.

  Update August 1, 2021 As of now, the next season of Trench League never happened and this project is yet to be put to use. Regardless, I learned a lot about Python and the Discord API for future projects.
About This Project The idea behind this project initially started two years ago when I was a player in the league. The Trench League is a (very) amateur Dota 2 league that allows players in the &lsquo;Trench&rsquo; to play the game in a more competitive way.

    <h1>Learning the Discord API</h1>

  About This Project The purpose of this project was to learn the Discord API/Python for the development of the discord bot for Trench League. This journal entry will describe my experience creating a basic discord bot with no experience with the Discord API.
Where to Start? Step 1 is to actually create the bot application. This is done by going to
https://discord.com/developers/applications
and creating a New Application. You then create the bot, add it to a guild, and you are off to the races.
