  <h2 id="about-this-project">About This Project</h2>
<p>I have always enjoyed journaling, whether it be about projects that I am working on in
school or on the side, or things I am experiencing in my life. It serves as an escape from
reality and as a way to reflect on my experiences and improve myself. Specifically with
coding, I find it beneficial to journal about school and personal projects because I learn
the material better and more often than not discover alternate ways that I could have used
to solve various problems.</p>
<p>Over this past summer, I wanted to learn more about web development to find out if it is
something I am interested in and want to pursue more in college. So, I decided to combine
these two interests and make a web portfolio/journal to log my past, present, and future
projects.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-where-to-start">Figuring Out Where to Start</h2>
<p>I considered a few different options for creating this website. From my research, the best
way to create a website for the purpose that I wanted (a more sophisticated journal) was
to use github pages and the hugo framework for building websites.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-site-content">Creating the Site Content</h2>
<p>The Hugo Framework uses HTML, CSS, and MARKDOWN files. The first step was to download and
customize a theme. I chose the most simple theme I could find and went to work making it
my own. I customized the landing page and got to work on the content.</p>
<h2 id="project-pages">Project Pages</h2>
<p>I already had some journal entries regarding projects I have completed in the past, but they
were mostly word documents with poor formatting. I got to work converting them to Markdown
files.</p>
<p>My past experience with Markdown files has been limited creating basic README files with text
only. I wanted to make the pages on my site look better than a bunch of raw text, so I learned
more about the syntax for Markdown files. Below is the basic syntax that I used to create this
site:</p>
<h4 id="-headers">## Headers</h4>
<p><code>`inline code segments`</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>block code segments

you can also use syntax highlighting

```[language]
code goes here
```
</code></pre><p><img src="/post/images/img_path.png" alt="img_path"> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h2>
<p>Now that the content of the website is complete, it is time to put it on github pages.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Making this website taught me a lot about HTML, CSS, Markdown, and git. In the future, I would
like to add more personal content such as an about tab that contains a resume and other
descriptions about my experiences (once I become more experienced). This site is a good
way to reflect on my past experiences with computer science as well as log future ones.</p>
